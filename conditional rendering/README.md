### Conditional Rendering
1. We can do conditional rendering, i.e. Choosing what DOM that we want to show
2. Keyword: v-if, v-else-if, and v-else
3. We can use v-show so that if the condition is not met, then the DOM's attribute display will be set to none, which means hidden
    - it is more efficient as we don't need to delete DOM (need to research more about this)
